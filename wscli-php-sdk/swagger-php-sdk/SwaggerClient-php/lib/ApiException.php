/**
 * ISECure WS Channel API
 *
 * The API provides normal file based access to all common banks in Finland via WebServices channel on the service side, including certificate enrollment (PKI) with automatic renewals. Additionally, user account management, password recovery, and SMS based 2nd or Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) are provided (AWS Cognito Your User Pool). Access is secured with HTTPS/TLS (AWS API Gateway), using email address as username and password. On login, password is RSA encrypted along with dynamic parameters fetched from the service (username specific challenge response). Every integrator has own API Key and every user account belongs to one integrator. Certificate sharing between accounts is possible under the same integrator API Key, meaning that the enrolled bank connection certificates are shared. Under the same email address / username, both *admin* and *data* accounts must be used as they have separate passwords and differing functions.
 *
 * OpenAPI spec version: v2.3.1
